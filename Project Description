This project will, hopefully, be able to take an image of my own face as an input, and return the current emotion I am most likely
feeling based on my facial expression. The emotions I will train the program on will be limited to "Happy", "Sad", "Shocked", "Disgusted",
and "Neutral".

I will be using a few libraries, possibly more than the ones I list here:

- Numpy
- TensorFlow
- Sklearn
- Theano

The interface will contain a prompt to upload the image of my face. After the upload, it will display the image
and a prompt to analyze it. Then, it will attempt to classify the image into one of the aforementioned emotions.

By the first demo, the program should have more than a 50% accuracy on only my face. Though I hope to make the program
accurate on other faces as well, I cannot say that such a feature would be present by then

My final submission will have an improved accuracy, and will hopefully function on more than just my face. Most likely,
it will work on new images of faces that were in the training set. I'm going for over 80% accuracy.
